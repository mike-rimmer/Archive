          SUPPORT THE COLLECTION
        </h3>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in supporting the Museumâ€™s collections. There are a number of ways you can support the collection; including monetary contributions.  Donations to our General Fund supports collections and exhibit work, along with other Museum projects; while donations to the Digital Collections Fund will provide funds for the digitising of the collection - namely ship plans and photographs. If you would like to contribute to either of the funds, please use the form below.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Why digitise the collection? </span>Digital collections provide greater access for educational and research purposes, allowing individuals to access the collections remotely. A digital collection also facilitates virtual educational programs with local schools and the community.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in donating material to the Museum, such as photographs or artefacts, please contact our Museum Manager <a href="mailto:marmus@marmuseum.ca">Email Maritime Museum</a>.</p>
