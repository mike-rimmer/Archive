  <h3>Preface</h3>

  <p>Canada Steamship Lines, a division of The CSL Group, is based in Montreal, Quebec with affiliate offices in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Winnipeg, Manitoba. </p>

  <p>Formed in 1913 from a conglomerate of over ten other marine companies, that also included bulk freighters, schooners, passenger vessels and shipbuilding and repair facilities.  Throughout losses during both World Wars, onboard tragedies and vessels lost to storms, Canada Steamship Lines continues to operate on the Great Lakes and Worldwide. </p>

  <h3>Forward</h3>

  <p>With vessels dating as far back as the early 1840â€™s, you can see how the marine history of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence seaway was created and maintained by the companies that predated the formation of Canada Steamship Lines.</p>

  <p>Covering from Port Arthur and Fort William (present-day Thunder Bay) to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, across Georgian Bay to the lower Great Lakes and down the St. Lawrence River, the over 250 ships in Canadian Steamship Lines company history from 1913 to the present day can be traced in the Marine Museum online database.</p>
