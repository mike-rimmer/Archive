  <h3>Preface</h3>
  <p>Frederick William Wallace was a noted journalist, photographer, historian, film director and novelist. As an author he wrote thirteen books and numerous magazine articles. Two of his books are considered among the best in historical works for Canadian marine history. He first wrote Wooden Ships and Iron Men as a testament to the spirit of the Age of Sail. Following up with The Record Of Canadian Shipping in 1929 which originally had only 1000 copies printed and those copies are held in esteem in many private collections, museum and libraries. </p>

  <p>The “Scot Sailor” was notable for his knowledge on Canadian sailing and marine history. He was quoted in many early marine company newsletters and in books such as Passage To The Sea: The Story Of Canada Steamship Lines where he discusses early vessels of the company and in Tall Ships And Tankers The History of the Davies Shipbuilders which he talks about the murder of George T. Davie, found of Davie Shipbuilding dynasty.  </p>

  <h4>Forward</h4>
  <p>In compiling this list of Canadian-built square-rigged sailing ships, the author has endeavoured to set down a full record of Canada's accomplishments in wooden shipbuilding during the age of sail. Apart from the hope that it will be of some value to the archivist, the author believes that it will aid the collector of nautical paintings, prints, photographs and marine memora- bilia in identifying his items as well as affording a source of basic information for the historian.</p>
  <p> The list has been conﬁned mainly to square-rigged vessels of 50o tons and over. In a few instances this limit has been waived, particularly in the case of vessels built prior to I840. Up to that date, the details regarding the largest square-rigged vessels built since I786 have been entered, as but very few craft were constructed during that period to register more than 50o tons. It may be superﬂuous to emphasize the fact that no steam- propelled vessels or schooners or wooden vessels built elsewhere than in Canada are included in this list. The vast ﬂeet of small ships, barques, barquentines, brigs and brigantines built in British North America during the days of wooden hulls have been omitted unless they measured 50o tons and over, except in the case aforementioned. Even with these restrictions, approximately 3700 vessels have been recorded in this volume. From this, an idea may be gained of the magnitude of Canada’s marine construction during the Golden Age of Sail.</p>
  <p>The basis of the work of compilation has been the Shipping Registers of the various ports, now stored in the Canadian Archives, Ottawa. The information thus obtained has been considerably augmented by the records of Lloyd’s Register, the American Shipmasters’ Association, the American Bureau of Shipping, American Lloyd’s and the Bureau Veritas. J. Murray Lawson’s “ Yarmouth Shipping,” Narcisse Rosa’s “ List of Quebec Ships ” and data from unofficial and private sources have played a large part in the compilation. While each item has been checked, as far as is possible, to ensure its correctness, yet errors are bound to creep in. It is also possible that some few vessels have been overlooked and not listed.</p>
  <p>Dimensions, tonnage and rig have been found to differ in the registry records of one ship. A barque may have been originally rigged as a ship, while re-measurement, alterations, or the employment of old or new measurement rules have materially affected tonnage and dimensions. Ports of registry and ownerships were often changed, and a vessel may bear one name in the original registry book and acquire another, soon after launching when transferred to another port.</p>
  <p>A certain laxity was found in recording the builder’s name in many official records. Sometimes it was the foreman builder who was credited; in other cases it was a contractor who had the work done by a shipbuilder, and instances were found in which a shipyard was borrowed for the work and the owner of the yard credited with the job. Many of these errors in official records have been corrected by the author from reliable private information. Against the name of each vessel, wherever possible, the author has entered certain remarks pertaining to her owner- ship, employment and ﬁnal end.</p>
  <p>Ships built in Canada and engaged in the Australian and New Zealand emigrant trade of the ’f1fties and ’siXties have been thus listed; Vessels owned and operated by the more important Canadian ownerships are designated together with their Canadian ports of registry. Most of the craft recorded herein held Canadian registries when launched, but these were transferred to British or other ports when the vessel was sold shortly afterwards. Hundreds of ships were built to be sold in Great Britain, and many played important roles in the history of British shipping.</p>
  <p>In this list, the Canadian port of registry has only been placed against vessels that were owned wholly or partly in Canada and accounted as being of the Canadian merchant marine. As the vast majority of British North American ships were constructed of what is called “ soft wood ” timber—spruce, tamarac or hackmatack, pine, etc.—and a goodly number of mixed woods, both soft and hard, the vessels that were constructed wholly of “ hard wood ” are thus designated in this list.</p>
  <p>Similarly, most of the vessels were of full models, but where a ship was of “ sharp ” or “ medium ” model, it has thus been recorded. The date wherein a vessel is recorded with a change of name or ﬂag is not to be taken as the year of transfer, but merely as a year when the ship was known to be under another ﬂag or name. It is a source of gratiﬁcation to the author that he has been able, through the assistance of many friends, to reproduce herein a splendid collection of photographs, paintings and drawings of Canadian-built vessels. From all parts of the world these pictures have been gathered, and many are scarce and valuable. They lend colour to cold facts and will serve to visualize the handiwork of long-gone craftsmen, as well as picture, to a generation that knows them not, the splendid fabrics of wood and canvas, rope and metal, that braved the watery wastes, wove the strands of commerce, and helped to build a greater empire than has been.
