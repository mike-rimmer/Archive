<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>
C.H.J. Snider (May 26, 1879-December 12, 1971) chronicled the early way to travel and do business on the Great Lakes in his 1,303 "Schooner Days" columns for Toronto’s The Evening Telegram between January 31, 1931, to  1954. His highest position was that of Managing Editor and he also was a trustee of the estate of John Ross Robertson, the Telegram's founder and also a great author on Ontario history.</p>

<p>Snider first sailed being at the helm of a schooner at the age of thirteen, later he would sail one of the most famous schooners on Lake Ontario, the Stuart H. Dunn, and these early travels let Snider study first-hand the development of the Great Lakes region.</p>

<h4>Forward</h4>
<p>Originally found among the scrapbook collections of many ship enthusiasts, Charles Henry Jeremiah Snider’s Schooner Days were laid out in the styles of an old salty dog telling stories to young boys. Where he tracked down old men who were just boys themselves when many of these schooners first hit the water of the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Snider was a great marine researcher and an accomplished artist who drew most of the sketches found in his columns. His sailing experience would help him write seven books on early Great Lakes shipping.</p>

<p>Conversely published on microfilm in the early seventies, Snider’s Schooner Days later were compiled with select stories into the book by Robert B. Townsend, entitled Tales From The Great Lakes in 1995 of which the Marine Museum Of The Great Lakes lent pictures from their collection. Schooner Days can now be enjoyed for researchers worldwide in a searchable online database at the Marine Museum Of The Great Lakes in Kingston, Ontario.</p>`
